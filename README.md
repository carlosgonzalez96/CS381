### Carlos Gonzalez & Michael Commins
The application will utilize a process and File I/O work in Elixir and how it varies in other functional languages like Standard ML. The application will create a process, which will create a child process. The child will read in a file with text and pipe it to its parent process. Once the text in the file is sent to the parent process it will then print the text out to the console. It makes good use of Elixirâ€™s built-in functions for I/O and process communication. We then will replicate this application in Standard ML and Ruby.
